I have shrimp left over from the Superbowl. They are already cooked, and some are jalapeno-honey, and some are chili-lime, and some are garlic-parmesan. Shrimp are decapod crustaceans with elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion - most commonly Caridea and Dendrobranchiata. More narrow definitions may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller species of either group or to only the marine species.
