recipeingredient:
- "3 cups 426g all purpose flour"
- "4 large or 5 small eggs"
recipeinstructions:
- "On a large flat clean surface place the flour in a mound."
- "Crack all 4 large eggs into the center of the mound of flour creating a well to hold the eggs."
- "Using a light hand, break the yolks of the egg and gently bring the flour into the center of the well using your fingertips."
- "Keep incorporating the flour into the eggs until all the flour has been absorbed. This will be a messy process, but it is well worth it! Once the dough starts to form, bring it together with your palms and knead into a smooth yellow dough. This will take roughly 5 minutes. Note: if your dough is on the dry side you can add a little SLASH of water to bring it together."
- "When the dough forms a ball, cover tightly with cling wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes to allow the dough the rest and the gluten to develop. No longer than 18 hours."
- "After resting, remove the dough from the fridge and cut into 4 equal pieces. Set aside and cover with a towel to stop it from drying out."
- "Flour your work surface and rolling pin and roll 1 ball of dough at a time into a large thin sheet. I don&#39;t give dimensions for this part as it varies but my one note would be to get it as thin humanly possible. Like paper thin."
- "Once the dough has been rolled out, fold it over itself several times. Cut the roll of pasta into strips roughly 1/4 inch thick depending on what pasta you are making. Then dust some flour over the sliced strips of dough and unravel them to reveal your fresh pasta! Repeat this process with the remaining dough."
- "Set cut pasta aside on a tray and leave out at room temperature to cook off or cover and place in the fridge to be cooked later."
