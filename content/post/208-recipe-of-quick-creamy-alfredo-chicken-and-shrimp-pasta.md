Chicken Alfredo pasta was my favorite &#34;fancy&#34; restaurant order as a kid â€” luxe sauce clinging to Alfredo is a creamy, dreamy pan sauce made from butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Grab some fettuccine, cream, Parmesan, and a few chicken breasts at the store and you&#39;ll probably have. I love the Alfredo sauce but usually I make it with one type of meat only: either chicken or shrimp. This time I decided to combine both and the result got me squealing with excitement! A big pile of pasta covered in a delicious creamy wine sauce and packed with tender shrimp and chicken.
