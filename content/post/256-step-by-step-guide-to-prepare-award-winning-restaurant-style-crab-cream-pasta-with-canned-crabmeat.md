- "Mix the sauce and the pasta well over low-medium heat. When the sauce is bubbling and slightly thickened, turn off the heat."
- "Make sure not to overcook the sauce, or it will turn grainy. Transfer to a serving plate, sprinkle with the C. ingredients, and serve."
- "The only salt in the dish comes from the pasta water and the canned crabmeat, but I think it&#39;s just right."
