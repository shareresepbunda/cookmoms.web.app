Tender, juicy beef and broccoli smothered in a special glossy sauce. Who needs to order takeout when you have a Beef and Broccoli recipe sourced from a Beef and Broccoli - not authentic, and that&#39;s ok! I haven&#39;t travelled extensively throughout China but in the time I did spend there, I can say. Shrimp and Broccoli was one of the most often ordered dishes at our family&#39;s Chinese restaurant.
