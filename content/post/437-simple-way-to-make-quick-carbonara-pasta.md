- "1/2 pound pancettathick cut baconchicken ham Diced"
- "2 cloves garlic finely minced"
- "3-4 whole eggs"
- "5 pcs white button mushroom"
- "1 cup grated parmesan"
- "1 pound spaghetti pasta cook as per instruction"

recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the water to cook the pasta.. Add generous salt inside the water"
- "While the water is coming to boil, heat some oil in the pan over medium heat, add bacon/pancetta and cook until crispy. Add garlic and mushroom, continue cooking for another few minutes. Turn off the heat and move it into a large bowl"
- "In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese."
- "Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil until al dente (a little firm, not mushy)"
- "Use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon, mushroom and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water."

- "Mix in the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. Add freshly chopped parsley too :) Serve with creamy mushroom soup and salad as side dish ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‹ðŸ¤¤"
